## Cancer Detection in CT Scans using Forman–Ricci Curvature

In this project, I explored a mathematical method for detecting cancerous tumors in CT scans using Forman–Ricci curvature. The approach combines advanced concepts from geometry and topology with practical tools from image processing.

### 💡 What I Did
- I converted CT images into mathematical graphs.  
- I computed discrete curvature for each edge in the graph.  
- I built heatmaps to highlight regions with highly negative curvature values.  
- I implemented and compared the method in both MATLAB and Python.  

### 🛠️ Technologies
- MATLAB  
- Python  
- Image processing libraries  
- Graph theory algorithms  

### 🔎 Results
I successfully detected suspicious tumor-like regions across different scans (brain, lungs, pelvis). MATLAB produced sharper and more reliable detection, while Python provided faster execution.

### 🚀 Learning Outcomes
I learned how to apply abstract mathematical theories (geometry and topology) to practical algorithms. I gained experience in multi-language implementation, image processing, and interpreting medical data.

### 🌟 Personal Reflection
I am truly proud of what I achieved! This project showed me how abstract mathematical concepts can be transformed into real-world solutions with potential impact in medical diagnostics.
